This project focuses on predicting CO2 emissions based on various vehicle specifications, such as engine size, fuel type, and fuel consumption. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to understand the relationship between these factors and their impact on the environment. The model uses regression analysis to predict the carbon emissions of different vehicles, providing insights that could help in making more eco-friendly vehicle choices.
